## SmartNotes
*June, 2021.*

The goal was to develop a computer application "SmartNotes" with several functions. The application allows registered user to:
* create a simple note with the title, text, and date,
* create a To-Do list, e.g. for shopping, with the option to cross out the activities when they are done,
* enter important events, such as a friend's birthday, and request a reminder which will occur as a Windows OS reminder,
* mark his records as favorites so he can easily access them later and search through them or use filters. There is also option to see statistics and graphs for all the tasks in the selected period.

Used technologies:
* C#, MSSQL
